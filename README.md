printf
 is the C language function to do formatted printing.In this project we made the tasks 0 - 2 of mandatory part, and the 14 advanced tasks. The first task develop the function as such, only with the c, s and % specifiers. Then, the next task, add more specifiers.
This team project is a custom made printf function for the C programming language called _printf. It has been optimized to take various inputs and optional arguments based exactly on how the standard library function printf works. We submitted this as part of the ALX software engineering course requirement for grading.
